# Mobile App Development Final Project - General Planner App

For my final project I created a general planner application in Java using Android Studio that allows the user to create an account to store and save their events. The user is able to title and set a date for their events before adding it to a list that showcases all of the past saved events. Once created, the events are stored in the Firebase Realtime Database. These events can be deleted by the user if they so choose which if done will also update the database.

### Bugs
- The app will crash if either the username or password fields are left blank in either the Login Page or Register Page
